# Face Attribute Extraction-YOLOv7
This system is designed to detect and extract various facial attributes such as age, gender, emotion, and more from live video feeds or images, enabling real-time analysis in diverse applications. Utilizing the power of YOLOv7, this solution achieves a balance between speed and accuracy for extracting facial features in real-world environments.

## Real-Time Face Attribute Extraction using YOLOv7

This repository contains the implementation of a real-time face attribute extraction system using the YOLOv7 model. The system is designed to detect faces and extract relevant attributes in live video feeds or static images, making it a powerful tool for analysis in security, health, and marketing sectors.

## Dataset

Here's the link to the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/faces-age-detection-dataset

## Features

- **Real-Time Processing**: Efficiently extracts facial attributes with minimal delay.
- **High Accuracy**: Leverages the YOLOv7 model for precise face attribute detection and extraction.
- **Multi-Attribute Detection**: Capable of identifying multiple attributes such as age, gender, emotion, etc.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face-Attribute-Extraction-YOLOv7.git
   cd face-attribute-extraction-YOLOv7

2. **Install Dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Prepare Your Model:**
Ensure that your YOLOv7 model is downloaded and that the .xml and .bin files are in place.


4. **Model and Weights:**
   The Model files and model weights are uploaded in Kaggle and here's the link to model weights and files 
    https://www.kaggle.com/models/srivatsavvenkat/face-attribute-extraction

   To use the model in real time on your local environment download the model weights zip file and change the model weights path in code and run to get the final output
